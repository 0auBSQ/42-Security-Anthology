## Important information

- The .c or .cpp files are pseudo code and don't compile
- All of the reverse enginering is done using the `objdump` command to get a dissassembled file, using a decompiler like Reko, Snowman or Ghidra is forbidden here
- We listed all our attempts on the write-ups, including our fails
- Since we're still learning and begin in security, some write-ups can contains mistakes or wrong ASM explanations (especially the first ones), don't hesitate to post an issue if you notice something odd
