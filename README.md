# 42-Security-Anthology
42Paris security branch (Snow Crash, Rainfall, Override, Darkly, Boot2Root)

## Important information

- This repo contains the whole 42 security branch, each project validated with a 125 mark
- Note that some write ups can contains mistakes, we're still learning in security and those projects are introductions
- Don't use those writeups to do your projects, spoiling yourself can be contreproductive and waste the interest of the project itself
- Sources given for Rainfall and Override don't compile (pseudo code) and are pretty approximative, they're translated by hand (using Ghidra or any other decompiler was forbidden) and their only puropose is to illustrate the assembly result in a more understandable form
- This repo is legacy, I don't plan to fix the mistakes or typos on it
- Each readme contains the name and github of people I worked with, please check their work as well
- Boot2Root writeups are in French only
