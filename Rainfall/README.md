## Harder security Project

## Important information

- Bonuses are comming soon
- The .c or .cpp files are pseudo code and don't compile
- All of the reverse enginering is done using the `objdump` command to get a dissassembled file, using a decompiler like Reko, Snowman or Ghydra is forbidden here
- We listed all our attempts on the write-ups, including our fails
- Since we're still learning and begin in security, some write-ups can contains mistakes or wrong ASM explanations (especially the first ones), don't hesitate to post an issue if you notice something odd

## Level 0 - ELF32 - C - Basic reverse enginering

C'est atoi
C'est à toi
(This may be the worst IT pun in french ever)

## Level 1 - ELF32 - C - Stack buffer overflow - Explicit system call

Like a legendary corrector would say : "GNL a la poubelle, cf man fgetc()"

## Level 2 - ELF32 - C - Stack buffer overflow - No system call (Ret2libC)

Some people return to C piscine, some to libC

## Level 3 - ELF32 - C - Format string exploitation - Small offset

Your local Franprix is 100m away

## Level 4 - ELF32 - C - Format string exploitation - Big offset

Your local Franprix is 100km away

## Level 5 - ELF32 - C - Format string exploitation - Implicit call (GOT)

No, it's not Game of Thrones

## Level 6 - ELF32 - C - Heap overflow - Explicit system call

When you're a cheap dev and say "Oh, just a segfault don't worry, doesn't affect the intended use"

## Level 7 - ELF32 - C - Heap overflow - Implicit call (GOT)

Actually, it's far better than Game of Thrones

## Level 8 - ELF32 - C - Use after free - Filter bypass

In french, we would say it's a Trou de mémoire

## Level 9 - ELF32 - C++ - Stack buffer overflow - No system call - 4 bytes limit (Shellcode)

Only 4 bytes, like in the 20th century

## Bonus 0 - ELF32 - C - Stack buffer overflow - No system call (Shellcode)

Better twice than once

## Bonus 1 - ELF32 - C - Underflow exploit

Implicit type casts are always amazing

## Bonus 2 - ELF32 - C - Stack buffer overflow - No system call (Shellcode)

Never two without three

## Bonus 3 - ELF32 - C - Piscineux style codding

Like on my high school days
